# Question 8

# Function and method calls can take expressions as arguments. 
# Suppose we define a function named rps as follows, which 
# follows the classic rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, but 
# with a slight twist: in the event of a tie, it just returns the 
# choice made by both players.

def rps(fist1, fist2):
    if fist1 == "rock":
        return "paper" if fist2 == "paper" else "rock"
    elif fist1 == "paper":
        return "scissors" if fist2 == "scissors" else "paper"
    else:
        return "rock" if fist2 == "rock" else "scissors"
    
# What does the following code output?
print(rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock"))

# paper
# inner 2 function calls: rps("rock", "paper") - paper
#                         rps("rock", "scissors") - rock

# rps(rps("paper", "rock"), "rock")
# inner 1 function call: rps("paper", "rock") - paper

# rps("paper", "rock") - paper

# LS:
# The outermost call determines the result of comparing rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")) against rock. That means that we must evaluate the two separate calls, rps("rock", "paper") and rps("rock", "scissors"), and combine them by calling rps on their results. Those innermost expressions return "paper" and "rock", respectively. Calling rps on those two values returns "paper", which, when evaluated against "rock", returns "paper".
