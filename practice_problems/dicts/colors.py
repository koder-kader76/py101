# What would the following code output? Try to answer 
# without running the code.

colors = {'red': 5, 'blue': 10, 'green': 15}
if 'yellow' in colors:
    print(colors['yellow'])
else:
    print('Key not found')

# This code will output 'Key not found'. When Python performs membership operation using in on dictionaries, it will check for the specific keys in the dictioinary. Since 'yellow' is not a key in colors dictionary, the if statement is falsy and the else block will execute.
# This code demonstrates when checking values with in operator, it will perform the check on keys, not the values. Second, it also demonstrates truthiness in conditionals where a code block is only executed is it evaluates to True.

# Revised Explanation:
# "This code will output 'Key not found'. When Python performs the membership operation using in on dictionaries, it checks for the presence of specific keys in the dictionary. Since 'yellow' is not a key in the colors dictionary, the condition 'yellow' in colors evaluates to False, and the else block executes.
# This code demonstrates two important concepts: First, when using the in operator with dictionaries, Python checks for keys, not values. Second, it demonstrates conditional execution in Python, where a code block executes only when its condition evaluates to true."
